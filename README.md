# 🏏 TATA IPL 2025 Power BI Dashboard

## Objective / Problem Statement

The objective of this Power BI project is to develop a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for analyzing the TATA IPL 2025 season using ball-by-ball match data. With cricket generating massive volumes of performance metrics, there is a need for a dynamic tool that can:

⦁	Present player statistics like runs scored, wickets taken, batting averages, and strike rates in a clean and insightful format.

⦁	Track bowler performance through economy rates and match impact.

⦁	Evaluate team-wise trends in total runs, wickets, and match outcomes.

⦁	Provide match-specific breakdowns to understand turning points and player contributions on a per-match basis.

⦁	Identify top performers (MVPs) using aggregated metrics.

⦁	This dashboard aims to help fans, analysts, and decision-makers gain data-driven insights into IPL 2025 with real-time filters and visuals — empowering smarter evaluation of teams, players, and match strategies.
